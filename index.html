                    Yoga is a discipline that builds mental and physical strength by turning the mind inward to find
                    greater balance and inner peace.Yoga has numerous physical and mental benefits. Physically, it can
                    improve flexibility, strength, and balance, as well as reduce stress and tension in the body.
                    Mentally, yoga has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, improve focus and
                    concentration, and enhance overall well-being. Additionally, practicing yoga can also have spiritual
                    benefits, such as promoting self-awareness and inner peace. With its low-impact movements, yoga can
                    be easily adapted to suit people of all ages and fitness levels. Overall, incorporating yoga into
                    one's daily routine can lead to a healthier and happier lifestyle.
